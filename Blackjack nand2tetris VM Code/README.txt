HOW TO PLAY BLACKJACK:

1) As you already may know, the src folder contains the code in .jack file-type.
2) To run the code, please use nand2tetris tools to convert .jack code to VM code.
3) Run the VM code in the VM emulator to see the output as desired.

Important points to note:

4) Randomness was a hard concept to achieve in this code, and it is not perfect.
So when the program prompts you to enter a key at random at the starting of the game,
please ensure that you press a unique key, as this is how the randomness of the game
is decided. For eg, if you press "Y" key everytime you start the game, the game will
repeat the same logic.
5) Animation is limited, I've tried my best to incorporate a little animation in the code.
6) If you find that the program is too fast for your liking, please increase the 
sys.wait(2000) intervals to sys.wait(10000) your code.
7) Have fun!
